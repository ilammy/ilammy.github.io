[Travis CI joins the Idera family](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2019-01-23-travis-ci-joins-idera-inc)<br/>
Oh well... That's _the_ Idera which currently owns Delphi (previously Embarcadero (previously CodeGear (previously Borland))). I guess I'll start using CircleCI for my personal projects from now on.
