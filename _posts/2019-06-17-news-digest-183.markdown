It seems that 17th day of month slowly becomes more and more significant for me.

### C++

[Who ordered memory fences on an x86?](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2008/11/05/who-ordered-memory-fences-on-an-x86/)<br/>
A bit on memory load-store reorerding in the most popular server architecture.

[The _Badge_ pattern](https://awesomekling.github.io/Serenity-C++-patterns-The-Badge/)<br/>
I'm constantly amazed at the amount of totally unintended features of C++ template system.

[Formatting floating point numbers](http://www.zverovich.net/2019/02/11/formatting-floating-point-numbers.html)<br/>
Just a nice story of bit-twiddling.

### Development

Big data is still an alien concept to me, but this post is okay. Though beware: that's a long read.

### Rust

何のフレームワークですか😅 (In all seriousness, it looks cool.)

### Security

[RAMBleed attack](https://rambleed.com/)<br/>
Rowhammer exploits are not theoretical now (though, extremely slow at the moment).<br/>

### Web

[Encryption for gopher](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?gopher://tilde.team:70/0/~rain1/phlog/20190608-encrypting-gopher.txt)<br/>
Я взагалі тільки нещодавно дізнався, що Gopher is still alive and kicking. Пам'ятаю, як читав про нього в підручнику з HTML4. Цей пост відображається за допомогою [цього проксі](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/), бтв.

### Miscellaneous

[Desktop Neo: rethinking the desktop interface for productivity](https://desktopneo.com/)<br/>
Idea of tiling WM for macOS. Only a design idea from 2016, though.

[MrBeast channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA)<br/>
Okay, this is one twisted performance art form going on here. Pure capitalism.
