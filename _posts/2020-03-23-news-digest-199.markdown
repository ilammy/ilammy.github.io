### Developments

[Timeouts and cancellation for humans](https://vorpus.org/blog/timeouts-and-cancellation-for-humans/)<br/>
About handling IO timeouts in library API. I guess this will be the one thing that a new language can improve on. Or... there's always _dynamic scoping_.

### Open Source

[npm is joining GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/)<br/>
Yes, they bought it. I'm off setting up mirrors, just in case.

### UNIX

[Text processing in the shell](https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/text-processing-in-the-shell)<br/>
Pretty cool overview with examples of various tools like `wc` and `tr`.

[What is fsck up to now?](https://toroid.org/what-is-fsck-up-to-now)<br/>
A story about progress bars. (Also, did you know about `dd` on Linux supporting SIGUSR1? Or the SIGINFO signal on BSD?)
