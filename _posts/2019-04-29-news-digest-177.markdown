Happy Golden Week. New era incoming in two days...

### C++

[Top 25 C++ API design mistakes and how to avoid them](https://www.acodersjourney.com/top-25-cplusplus-api-design-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/)<br/>
Obvious in the hindsight, but nevertheless important.

### Development

[Implementing reader-writer locks](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/implementing-reader-writer-locks/)

[Implementing tile encoding in rav1e](https://blog.rom1v.com/2019/04/implementing-tile-encoding-in-rav1e/)

[Make is (probably) fine](https://blog.yossarian.net/2019/04/23/Make-is-probably-fine)<br/>
I came to really like _make_ recently. It's a beautiful Prolog for filesystem.

### Rust

[Compile Time Memory Safety](https://kkimdev.github.io/posts/2019/04/22/Rust-Compile-Time-Memory-Safety.html)<br/>
[Programming in Rust: the good, the bad, the ugly](https://hackernoon.com/programming-in-rust-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-d06f8d8b7738)<br/>

[Rust's 2019 roadmap](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/04/23/roadmap.html)

### PLT

[Higher-rank and higher-kinded types](https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/115/higher-rank-and-higher-kinded-types)<br/>
In case you're curious but not into type theory.

[Lexical differential highlighting instead of syntax highlighting](https://wordsandbuttons.online/lexical_differential_highlighting_instead_of_syntax_highlighting.html)<br/>
I've seen this idea resurface from time to time. I wonder why mainstream IDEs don't do it often.

[A Brief And Brisk Overview of Compiler Architecture](https://blog.felixangell.com/compilers-brief-and-brisk)<br/>
Yet another one, never too late to understand how your tools work.

### Security

[Keybase is not softer than TOFU](https://keybase.io/blog/chat-apps-softer-than-tofu) [(на русском)](https://habr.com/ru/post/449350/)<br/>
On proper implementation of _Trust On First Use_.

[A Crash Course in Everything Cryptographic](https://medium.com/@lduck11007/a-crash-course-in-everything-cryptographic-50daa0fda482)<br/>
For newbies.

### Miscellaneous

[O(n<sup>2</sup>) in CreateProcess](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/on2-in-createprocess/)<br/>
Chromium developers discover loads of weird behaviors like this one.

[Busy Person Patterns](https://hillside.net/plop/2006/Papers/Library/PLoP%20Busy%20Person%20Pattern%20v8.pdf)<br/>
A nice read on time/task management.

[Maybe we could tone down the JavaScript](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/)<br/>
Stating the obvious.

[Pepsi's Nonsensical Logo Redesign Document: $1 Million for This?](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pepsis-nonsensical-logo-redesign-document-1-million-for-this/)<br/>
Read [the linked PDF](https://jimedwardsnrx.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/pepsi_gravitational_field.pdf) too, it's hilarious.
