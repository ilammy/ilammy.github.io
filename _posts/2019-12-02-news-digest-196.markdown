“Unmitigated pedantry” it is.

    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37681006">Jennicam: The first woman to stream her life on the Internet</a>
  </summary>
  <p>
    That's a BBC story from 2016 that started this binge.
    You can also look at
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Ringley">Wikipedia article</a>
    as a starting point.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some coverage at the time:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-oct-01-ls-37894-story.html">Jenni, Jenni, Jenni: A Life Laid Bare on the Computer Screen</a> (1997)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/13013765/voyeur-eyes-only">Voyeur Eyes Only: Jennifer Ringley's real-time web of life</a> (1997)</li>
    <li><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9903/26/jennicam/">'Ed' of the Internet: JenniCAM going strong after three years</a> (1999)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Also, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498329/">this movie</a> and <a href="https://www.utopiatv.nl/live">this TV program</a>.
    And a punchline: Jennifer did this <em>24 year ago</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, it's interesting from sociological point of view: like what historians in 50–100 years will think about early age of the Internet, and this whole practice of “life streaming”. Especially given the privacy-conscious context of recent years.
