_let's start with English this year_

### C++

[Тесты на C++ без макросов и динамической памяти](https://habr.com/post/434906/)<br/>
Interesting thing to explore. I always liked to look at minimal unit testing frameworks for C, like [Cutter](http://cutter.sourceforge.net).

### Development

[Good Engineering Practices while Working Solo](https://blog.bitsrc.io/good-engineering-practices-while-working-solo-ad872e727af4)

### Linux

[Learning KVM - implement your own Linux kernel](https://david942j.blogspot.com/2018/10/note-learning-kvm-implement-your-own.html)<br/>
Writing a basic hypervisor with KVM is not _that_ scary (though certainly not easy as well).

### Curious

[Модернизация IDA Pro. Отладчик для Sega Mega Drive (часть 1)](https://habr.com/post/434992/) [(часть 2)](https://habr.com/post/435002/)<br/>
How to write IDA Pro extensions.

[Перспектива: MultiClet S1](https://habr.com/post/434982/)<br/>
An interesting approach to CPU architecture. I remember posting about it some time ago, glad they're still alive.

[Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8&feature=youtu.be) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/HackerPoet/NonEuclidean)<br/>
**Amazing** hack. I imagine tons of creative applications for VR. [Mathematics _are_ beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slT4yb8mEac), Alice Liddell sends her regards.

### Miscellaneous

[English notes #1: Заканчивай с этим «very»](https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/434648/)<br/>
May turn out an interesting series for some.

[Exposing Floating Point](https://ciechanow.ski/exposing-floating-point/)<br/>
A summary of IEEE 754 if you need a refresher.
