I have found my favorite newbie-friendly entry-level book to recommend on C++. Thank you; you know who you are.

[Тесты на C++ без макросов и динамической памяти](https://habr.com/post/434906/)<br/>
I always liked to look at minimal unit testing frameworks for C, like [Cutter](http://cutter.sourceforge.net).

[orangeduck/mpc - A Parser Combinator library for C](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc)<br/>

[Software Engineering at Google](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01715.pdf)<br/>
“The aim of this paper is to catalogue and briefly describe Google’s key software engineering practices.”

[Hints for Computer System Design (1983)](http://bwlampson.site/33-Hints/Acrobat.pdf)<br/>

### Linux

[Learning KVM - implement your own Linux kernel](https://david942j.blogspot.com/2018/10/note-learning-kvm-implement-your-own.html)<br/>
Writing a basic hypervisor with KVM is not _that_ scary (though certainly not easy as well).

[Изучаем трассировку с помощью eBPF: Руководство и примеры](https://habr.com/post/435142/)<br/>
Some projects may not really need a kernel module.

### Curious

May be useful if you know close to nothing on the topic. An okayish explain-like-I'm-twelve writeup.
