_let's start with English this year_

Well, obviously happy birthday cheers go to Mr. Jesus (if you observe the Julian calendar).

### C++

[Тесты на C++ без макросов и динамической памяти](https://habr.com/post/434906/)<br/>
Interesting thing to explore. I always liked to look at minimal unit testing frameworks for C, like [Cutter](http://cutter.sourceforge.net).

### Development

[Good Engineering Practices while Working Solo](https://blog.bitsrc.io/good-engineering-practices-while-working-solo-ad872e727af4)

[GNU Recutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/)<br/>
I've never heard about this data format before, but it may be an interesting alternative to JSON.

Exploring basic antipatterns in writing automated tests. 

### Linux

[Learning KVM - implement your own Linux kernel](https://david942j.blogspot.com/2018/10/note-learning-kvm-implement-your-own.html)<br/>
Writing a basic hypervisor with KVM is not _that_ scary (though certainly not easy as well).

### Curious

[Перспектива: MultiClet S1](https://habr.com/post/434982/)<br/>
An interesting approach to CPU architecture. I remember posting about it some time ago, glad they're still alive.

[Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8&feature=youtu.be) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/HackerPoet/NonEuclidean)<br/>
**Amazing** hack. I imagine tons of creative applications for VR. [Mathematics _are_ beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slT4yb8mEac), Alice Liddell sends her regards.

[AI Winter - Update](https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/10/29/ai-winter-update/)<br/>
I'm not up to date on intricacies of state of the art AI, but his argument on the current state of affairs in AI is compelling.

[Trust model of Bitcoin — part I](https://hackernoon.com/trust-model-of-bitcoin-part-i-34aacf47d444), [part II](https://hackernoon.com/trust-model-of-bitcoin-part-ii-bfcfa15b8f09)<br/>
May interest you if you know close to nothing on the topic. An okayish explain-like-I'm-twelve writeup.

### Miscellaneous

May turn out an interesting series for some.
