### Development

[Some items from my "reliability list"](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2019/07/21/reliability/)

### Linux

[Extending the Kernel with Built-in Kernel Headers](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/extending-kernel-built-kernel-headers)<br/>
It should get easier to build kernel headers on the fly.

### Rust

[Why Rust for safe systems programming](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/)<br/>
People have been posting things like this from 2015 and will continue doing to until you like it.

[Things Rust shipped without](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/218040.html)<br/>
Yes, you can combat historically bad decisions.

[The Rust compiler is still getting faster](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2019/07/25/the-rust-compiler-is-still-getting-faster/) [(HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20522434)<br/>

[Plot to steal cryptocurrency foiled by the npm security team](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm)<br/>

is hardly a joke. Not in the world where people casually `npm install` whatever they pick up on the street.

### Miscellaneous

[Astronaut](http://astronaut.io)<br/>
Slice of life on this tiny blue marble.

[The Australians making music with computer code](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-21/live-coding-australia-music-computer-code/11301114)<br/>
Live music sampling always fascinated me, just like any live performance.<br/>
And there's more: they do it in Scheme!

[A grimoire of functions](http://fredrikj.net/blog/2019/05/a-grimoire-of-functions/)

[How we built the Waifu Vending Machine](https://waifulabs.com/blog/ax)<br/>
State of the art AI in action.

[Algebraic Effects for the rest of us](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/)<br/>
TIL that condition system from Common Lisp now has a proper formalism.

[Day 5: The VM-exit Handler, Event Injection, Context Modifications, and CPUID Emulation](https://revers.engineering/day-5-vmexits-interrupts-cpuid-emulation/)<br/>
Some information on CPU virtualization.
