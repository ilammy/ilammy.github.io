### C++

[Static analysis in GCC 10](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/03/26/static-analysis-in-gcc-10/)<br/>
GCC gets a static analysis pass, `-fanalyze`. Competetion with Clang does wonders.

Quality review of a book.

Cutie overview of synchronization in POSIX.

[Speeding up Linux disk encryption](https://blog.cloudflare.com/speeding-up-linux-disk-encryption/)</br>
Is crypto slow? Kinda, but not as slow as you'd expect. Includes a nice achaeology story.

[How is the Linux kernel tested?](https://embeddedbits.org/how-is-the-linux-kernel-tested/)<br/>
Pretty well, I'd say.

[The Reusability Fallacy – part 1](https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/), [part 2](https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_2/), [part 3](https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_3/)<br/>

### Miscellaneous

[Collections: The Fremen Mirage, Part IV: Desert Power](https://acoup.blog/2020/02/28/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iv-desert-power/)<br/>
This blog lives up to its name.

[An in-depth Look at OCaml’s new “Best-fit” Garbage Collector Strategy](http://www.ocamlpro.com/2020/03/23/ocaml-new-best-fit-garbage-collector/)<br/>
I always though of GCs as magnificent practical hack. A “hack” simultaneously as a work of art and as a kludge.

[A "living" Linux process with no memory](https://github.com/izabera/zeromaps) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22693805))<br/>
Funny edge case.

[New Hard Drive rituals](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2018/10/29/new-hard-drive-rituals/)<br/>
Do you have any?

[Tale of OpenBSD secure memory allocator internals - malloc(3)](https://bsdb0y.github.io/blog/deep-dive-into-the-OpenBSD-malloc-and-friends-internals-part-1.html)<br/>
“Deep” is not understatement, it’s a highly technical post.
