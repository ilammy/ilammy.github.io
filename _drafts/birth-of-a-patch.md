> talk about how I make patches to public projects
> this is about open-source which is labor of love
> I strive to keep the same process at my day job

> start with an idea
> look at an issue
> devise a way to resolve it
> (experience helps here)
> leave some message trail behind, useful in case you fluke and someone else has to deal with this

> wait for it... the desire to do the deed

> fork it, make a branch
> i like wip/ prefixes

> start hacking
> i do rather crappy commit messages
> keep in my head
> and todos
> and [tags] in messages
> but note that changes are still self-contained, these are not commits created every N minutes

> see something working at the end of hacking session
> [post screenshots]
> get satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment
> don't forget to push

> next day make a cleanup
> don't leave *too* long stream of incoherent commits, it is hard to rebase
> still don't bother with messages, just prune the intermediate changes and failed experiments

next:

> iterate development
> review patches, rehash changes between them
> make good commit messages
> what good messages are
> test your changes
> test bisectability
> make a PR
> write a good PR message
> wait for maintainers
> fix issues
> now you have a nice [contributor] badge, yay!
